# Parkinson-s-Disease-Classification

This project applies machine learning to classify Parkinson’s disease using voice recordings. Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature selection, and applying SMOTE for class balancing. Multiple models—Logistic Regression, SVM, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, and Random Forest—are trained and evaluated. Comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each model, emphasizing the importance of algorithm selection in medical diagnostics. Dive into the insights and enjoy!
